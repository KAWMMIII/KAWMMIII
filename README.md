## Hi ðŸ™ƒ

### Who am I? ðŸ¥¸
I'm a guy who's currently working to learn more about data science, who's also a student of Mathematics at Cambridge. ðŸ¤“

### What am I doing?ðŸ¤”
At the moment I've just completed a data science course, in which I learnt how to both visualise and analyse data using python. Specifically, using libraries including Pandas and Seaborn, and eventually, got more into depth on AI and machine learning. Also, I'm continuing my Mathematics course at the University of Cambridge.

### What have I done? ðŸ˜­
Like I've said I'm partway through a university course in mathematics. More recently I've been working on random stuff like:
* Visually simulating random movement in two dimensions, and from that, fitting trends in the generated data to statistical distributions plotted in python.
* Deriving equations for the [Riemann hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis) from scratch, allowing me to plot the Riemann zeta function and other similar functions easily, to potentially gather further insight into said hypothesis.

### What can I do? ðŸ¥´
* Languages
  * Python
  * SQL
* Databases
  * MySQL
* Version Control
  * GitHub
* Knowledge
  * University Mathematics
  * Advanced Physics
  * Advanced Computer Science

### Is that all? ðŸ¤¨
Yes, probably, maybe.
Here's one of those random movement sims I did that kinda looks like a duck... I think. For your troubles.
